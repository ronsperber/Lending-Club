# Lending Club
 
 Data from lending club to be used to attempt to predict bad loans
 
 Took data from https://www.kaggle.com/husainsb/lendingclub-issued-loans to try to build a model to predict whether a particular loan would be likely to be a bad loan.
 We defined bad loans as ones that were at least a month behind or in default.
